                Although I want this website to be as simple as possible, it doesn't mean that I can't
                add new features to it. In fact, I want it to be simple so I can add things more easily.
            
                <br><br>
            
                I am currently making a lot of changes to the site's layout, but soon I'll be back
                with a new version, completely remade from scratch. I'll probably use wordpress for that,
                even though I've never used it before, so it'll be a little adventure.
            
                <br><br>
            
                I guess it won't be that hard since it was made with people who don't know how to code in mind
                (I know a little bit; this website here is made using just html/css).
            
                <br><br>
            
                Well, I have this dumb mindset that if you use tools that make things easier for you, then it's not
                entirely your work. But this doesn't make sense at all; you still need to do things yourself; the 
                work will not finish by itself.
            
                <br><br>
            
                I had this idea when I was developing my game in Unity. I kinda felt like it wasn't my game, that
                I was using code that was already done. BUT THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF A GAME ENGINE; IT HAS SOME
                BORING STUFF ALREADY DONE FOR YOU TO USE; THAT'S A FRAMEWORK!
            
                <br><br>
            
                This is fcking stupid, and I'm finally starting to realize that. Recently, I heard this sentence by Carl Sagan,
                and I instantly agreed: "If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe."
            
                <br><br>
            
                There is no need to reinvent the wheel when you have a lot of great tools designed to help you with your work.
                <br><br>
            
                Well, besides all of that, I'm not going to stop the development of my game engine. I am just curious to see how things
                are really done behind the scenes. And if I think it's too hard, then I can just use godot or whatever. That's it for
                today; see you in the next post!
