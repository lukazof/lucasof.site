                In the past few months, I've been working on starting my new company: Trivalent. 
                This idea has been in my mind for years, and now I am slowly starting to make it happen.

                <br><br>

                Basically, if you don't know, Trivalent is meant to be a tech company, and there will be a lot 
                of different areas that we're going to work in, like game development, artificial intelligence, 
                applications for PC and mobile devices, etc. We are not restricted to something specific.

                <br><br>
                
                We aren't that type of company that you may think; we are not even legally declared yet. <br>
                So you can consider us just a small indie team.
                
                <br><br>

                And I want to announce that, from this moment forward, Trivalent already has servers operating in
                some regions of the world, and a few services are active and running.

                <br><br>
                
                Although we don't have anything big to offer yet, we are online! I just launched today the new 
                "Trivalent accounts," where you can create your account, which will be used in many Trivalent features.

                <br><br>
                
                I've already created my official Trivalent account, which basically means that I am the first user registered in the world!

                <br><br>
                
                There is still a lot to be done; I have some plans for the future, and in the next posts, I will give more details! See ya!
