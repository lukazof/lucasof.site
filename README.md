This is my personal website, it was built using <a href="https://sliver.trivalent.tech" target="_blank">**Sliver**</a>, which is a static website/blog generator that I created using **Python**.

The website itself is very simple, I tried to keep it very basic, without too much frills. Take a look at his homepage:
