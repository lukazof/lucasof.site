        <h1>How to Stay Organized</h1>
<p>Organization is one of the key elements to successfully create anything.</p>
<p>So, how to stay organized? Well, I am not organized at all, but i'm trying to change that. It can't be that hard, can it? There are different places where you can be organized, physically and digitally are examples.</p>
<h2>Physical Organization:</h2>
<p>I would say that staying organized physically is easier than digitally, it just requires a little bit of discipline, and that's all. I mean, just remove unnecessary items from your desk, and focus on not putting them there again.</p>
<p>A room with less distractions and unnecessary items will make much easier to focus on your tasks and avoid procrastination.</p>
<h2>Digital Organization:</h2>
<p>Like in the real world, things can become a mess virtually as well. This comes to emails, files on your storage devices, your desktop environment, etc.</p>
<p>One thing that I recommend is to separate your files by categories. For example, my hard disk is separated by the following folders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Documents</li>
<li>Video/Images</li>
<li>Music/Audio</li>
<li>Development</li>
<li>Programs</li>
<li>Games</li>
</ul>
<p>That way, I can always find what I want more easily. Organizing everything like this may be challenging, but you'll only have to do it once!</p>
<p>When it comes to desktop, I just remove every single item, leaving just the recycle bin. And when I'm working in a project, some of its files I can save in the desktop, then when I'm done, I can either relocate it or delete it.</p>

<p>How you organize things is up to you. Everyone can have their own preferences.</p>
<h2>Planning:</h2>
<p>An organized person is someone who plans their day. There are tons of ways to plan things, you can use to-do lists, which I recommend. You can use apps for that or opt for the traditional paper method.</p>
<p>Try to manage your time, and focus on doing the most complicated tasks first. You can also use the pomodoro technique, which is really useful. Well, there are a lot of other steps you need to do in order to stay organized, but Keeping things simple is often the most efficient approach.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know why I wrote all of this, nobody gives a shit. Maybe I wrote to myself, there is no way I can't organize things after this, right? Well, fuck it, see you in the next post!</p>
