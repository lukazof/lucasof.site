        <h1>Trivalent is Live!</h1>
<p>In the past few months, I've been working on starting my new company: Trivalent. This idea has been in my mind for years, and now I am slowly starting to make it happen.</p>
<p>Basically, if you don't know, Trivalent is meant to be a tech company, and there will be a lot of different areas that we're going to work in, like game development, artificial intelligence, applications for PC and mobile devices, etc. We are not restricted to something specific.</p>
<p>We aren't that type of company that you may think; we are not even legally declared yet.
So you can consider us just a small indie team.</p>
<p>And I want to announce that, from this moment forward, Trivalent already has servers operating in some regions of the world, and a few services are active and running.</p>
<p>Although we don't have anything big to offer yet, we are online! I just launched today the new &quot;Trivalent accounts,&quot; where you can create your account, which will be used in many Trivalent features.</p>
<p>I've already created my official Trivalent account, which basically means that I am the first user registered in the world!</p>
<p>There is still a lot to be done; I have some plans for the future, and in the next posts, I will give more details! See ya!</p>
