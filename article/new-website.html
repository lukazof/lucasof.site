        <h1>New Website!</h1>
<p>I'm releasing the new version of my website, and with new technologies!</p>
<h2>The new version</h2>
<p>Today, I'm finally releasing version 2.0 of my website. I'm doing this because the old
version was very bad; it was made with just HTML and CSS. Although this new version is also
made with HTML/CSS, I'm using a new technology that I created myself, which is Sliver.</p>
<p>Now I can easily create, edit, and manage the posts on my blog, and I can automatically make
changes to the entire website without needing to manually edit all the HTML files.</p>
<p>I don't plan to add a lot of new features to Sliver; I guess it serves its purpose for now. Plus,
I'm a noob in Python.</p>
<p>Now that I have this program, I'll probably post more often. I just need to improve my English
first; I'm using ChatGPT to correct my grammar mistakes. And sometimes I'll post in Portuguese as
well. It is MY website, so I can do that!</p>
<p>I guess that's it for this post; I don't have anything more useful to say. So, I'll see you later!</p>
