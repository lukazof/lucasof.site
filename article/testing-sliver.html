        <h1>Testing Sliver</h1>
<p>I am working on a <em>'static website/blog generator'</em> in Python, and I'm calling it Sliver for now.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in a previous post, I used to manually create all the .html files for the posts. So,
if I wanted to make a change in the header, for example, I would have to rewrite every single file,
and I don't need to say that this would be a pain.</p>
<p>Sliver works like this:</p>
<p>You have a config.yml file where you can edit some basic information about your website. Then you have
the layout/templates folders in which you can customize the styles of your website. You can also create
custom scripts/behaviors by editing the Python files, but be careful; you can mess everything up.</p>
<p>Well, I guess this is the first 'useful' project I've made so far. But it becomes useless when you realize
that there are alternatives like hugo or jekyll, which are 1000x better.</p>
<p>Sliver is in its first version, so, of course, it is very limited. However, I'm adding new features over time. I've
created it for my specific use, but the repo is public for everyone. In case you want to contribute to the project, here
is the link: https://github.com/lukazof/Sliver</p>
<p>Be aware that this is a temporary name, and I may change it in the future. Perhaps I'll come back to this post and edit it as well. I don't know; don't
count on that.</p>
<p>I guess that's it for today. I'm planning on posting more now that I have this super-powered tool. See ya!</p>
