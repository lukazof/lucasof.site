# Testing Sliver

I'm currently working on a Python-based "static website/blog generator" that I've temporarily named **Sliver**.

As mentioned in a previous post, I used to manually create all the .html files for my posts. If I needed to make a change in the header, for instance, I had to rewrite each file individually, which was quite a hassle.

### Sliver operates as follows:

You start with a **config.yml** file where you can modify basic website information. Then, you have the layout/templates folders where you can customize your website's styles. Additionally, you can create custom scripts and behaviors by editing the Python files, but be cautious not to inadvertently disrupt your project.

Sliver is currently in its initial version and comes with certain limitations. However, I'm gradually adding new features. Originally, I developed it for personal use, but I've made the repository public for anyone interested in contributing. You can find the project on GitHub here: Sliver on GitHub.

Please note that the name "Sliver" is provisional and subject to change in the future.

For now, I plan to use this super-powered tool for my website and blog. More updates to come, so stay tuned!
