# Trivalent is Live!

In the past few months, I've been working on starting my new company: Trivalent. This idea has been in my mind for years, and now I am slowly starting to make it happen.

Basically, if you don't know, Trivalent is meant to be a tech company, and there will be a lot of different areas that we're going to work in, like game development, artificial intelligence, applications for PC and mobile devices, etc. We are not restricted to something specific.

We aren't that type of company that you may think; we are not even legally declared yet.
So you can consider us just a small indie team.

And I want to announce that, from this moment forward, Trivalent already has servers operating in some regions of the world, and a few services are active and running.

Although we don't have anything big to offer yet, we are online! I just launched today the new "Trivalent accounts," where you can create your account, which will be used in many Trivalent features.

I've already created my official Trivalent account, which basically means that I am the first user registered in the world!

There is still a lot to be done; I have some plans for the future, and in the next posts, I will give more details! See ya!
